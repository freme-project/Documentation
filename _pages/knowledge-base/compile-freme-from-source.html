<p>This Guide will help you to recognise the requisites and the way you can start compiling FREME API.</p>
<p>Before getting started with FREME API you need to know that there are 3 Prerequisites you have to accomplish, these are: Java Runtime Edition and Java Development Kit (at least 7 of them); Maven and Git. You need to have all of them installed in your machine.</p>
<h2>1st Step: Add maven repository credentials</h2>
<p>for FREME API we have a private maven repository available, so the following step consists in providing a username and a password for your? repository.
</p>
<h3>1.1 XML File</h3>
<p>
To do it, you just need to create a xml file “settings.xml” with the following content:


<pre><code>
&lt;settings xmlns=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0&quot;
  xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
  xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                  http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd&quot;&gt;
  &lt;servers&gt;
    &lt;server&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;freme-nexus&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;username&gt;freme-nexus&lt;/username&gt;
      &lt;password&gt;THE PASSWORD&lt;/password&gt;
    &lt;/server&gt;
  &lt;/servers&gt;
&lt;/settings&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>1.2 Location:</h3>
<p>For machines using linux or mac: ~/.m2/settings.xml</p>
<p>For machines using windows: USERHOME/.m2/settings.xml</p>
<h3>1.3 Password</h3>
<p>Ask @jnehring for the password.</p>

<p>Now you can git clone any of the Git repositories. Maven will automatically download FREME dependencies from the maven repository. When you push a change to GitHub master branch then the Jenkins server will automatically create a new maven artifact and upload that artifact to Jenkins. So the maven repository always reflects the state of the master branches in the repositories.</p>

<h2>2nd Step: Compile a Project</h2>
<p>To compile any of the projects, use the mvn install command. All dependencies will be downloaded automatically. The FREME artifacts in the maven repository are automatically kept up to date by our continuous integration server. Upon every commit in a master branch it will upload the current SNAPSHOT version to the maven snapshot repository. During the release process the release artifacts are uploaded automatically to the maven release repository.
</p>
<h2>3rd Step: Create FREME distribution</h2>
<p>This creates the FREME distribution in folder target/FREME-VERSION-full/FREME-VERSION/ where VERSION is the version number of FREME.</p>
<p>Execute the following script:    </p>

<pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/freme-project/Broker.git
cd Broker
mvn package
</code></pre>

<h2>4th Steps: Failing unit tests</h2>
<p>FREME relies on some external APIs and when these APIs are unavailable then some unit tests might fail. </p>
<p>When this happens then you use the skipTests=true option to run the maven goal without unit tests, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>mvn install -DskipTests=true.</code></pre>

<h2>5th Step: Start server</h2>
<p>    To start FREME on <code>http://localhost:8080</code></p>
<p>For machines using Linux or Mac: </p>
<p>Open a command line in the distribution folder and type:</p>
<pre><code>
chmod +x bin/start_local.sh
bin/start_local.sh
</code></pre>
<p>For machines using Windows:</p>
<p>Open distribution folder in the following command line:</p>
<pre><code>
java -cp "./*:conf" eu.freme.broker.Broker
</code></pre>

<h2>6th Action: Create execution environment in IDE</h2>
<p>You can start the broker in your favourite IDE creating an execution environment that uses the following main class:
  <code>eu.freme.broker.Broker</code>
  </p>
