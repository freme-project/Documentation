How to add Documentation
---------------------

This page is there to explain how you can add or edit the content of this website!

This page is built using [jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) which makes it very easy to add or edit content.

To get started, visit our [Documentation's GitHub page](https://github.com/freme-project/Documentation).

All content of the Documentation is in the `_pages` folder. It should look something like this:

!../img/screenshot_pages.png!

All pages which are supposed to appear in dropdown boxes (e.g. this page appears in "Knowledge Base") belong in a specified folder.
