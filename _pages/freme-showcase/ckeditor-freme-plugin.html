<p><br>Enriching digital content with extra information involves a great deal of manual work such as looking up, copying and pasting text & images, and uploading audio or video fragments. With FREME integration, the author of a text has a wealth of information at his fingertips. The e-Entity service detects concepts and highlights them in the text. With a simple click, and using the e-Link service the author is able to fetch extra information on the requested topic from a dataset available on the web and use it to annotate the content.</p>
