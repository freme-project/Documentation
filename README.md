#Maintaining the Documentation Project

##Editing content

To edit the content of the pages, edit the files in the `_pages` folder. A full guide on how to add Documentation can be found at [here](api-dev.freme-project.eu/doc/knowledge-base/how-to-add-documentation.html).
To edit the API Documentation, edit `swagger/swagger.yaml`.

You can configure parameters such as `baseurl`, `url`, `fremeapiurl` (used for FREME Showcase) in the file `_config.yml`.

##Building

**On Api-Dev**

Jekyll, the CMS for this project is installed on the api-dev server. Everytime you push an updated version of this Documentation to the master branch, Jenkins will build a new version, so you don't need Jekyll installed.

**Locally**

Install jekyll

``` 
sudo apt-get install jekyll 
```

If it doesn't work the first time go for:

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
```



To build the _site folder:

```
jekyll build
```

To have the site served correctly (also calls `jekyll build`, updates itself with every edit in the files), run

```
jekyll serve
```

And go to `localhost:4000/<baseurl>/start.html` where baseurl is as of now `doc`.  Each call to `jekyll serve` will execute `swagger/yamlscript.py` which generates the Simple Api Documentation from the Full Api Documentation.

If you edit files in `_config.yml` then `jekyll serve` will not update these changes automatically. Close the `serve` process and restart it to see the changes.
